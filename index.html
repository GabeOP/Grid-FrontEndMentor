        <h2 id="daniel-text2">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a 
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
        the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br>never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from 
          professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former 
          student of theirs <br>who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff 
          did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team 
          project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial 
          could ever have. In<br> fact, I've often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent 
          experience. It certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers. 
          100% recommend! ”
